# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Week4-Project
## The purpose of this assignment
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. The project content, such as R script and codebook, will be graded by the peers. 

## Files contained in this repository are: 
- *README.md*: offers clear background information of this repository
- *run_analysis.R*: the R script that lists out all the necessary steps to reach the requests of this project as followed...
  1.Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.  
  2.Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.  
  3.Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.  
  4.Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.    
  5.From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
- *Codebook.md*: illustrate the variables listed in the data set
- *mean_tidy_data.txt*: the file generated in step 5
